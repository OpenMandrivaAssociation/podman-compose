%description
An implementation of Compose Spec with Podman backend. This project focuses on:

* rootless
* daemon-less process model, we directly execute podman, no running daemon.

Podman (the POD MANager) is a tool for managing containers and images, volumes
mounted into those containers, and pods made from groups of containers.

Podman is based on libpod, a library for container lifecycle management that is
also contained in this repository. The libpod library provides APIs for
managing containers, pods, container images, and volumes.
